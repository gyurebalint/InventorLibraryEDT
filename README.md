# InventorLibraryEDT - ClassLibrary

This ClassLibrary is a work in progress to make our jobs easier when writing tools for the designers. In the last year we worked on standardizing our design library,
so we can design faster and insert differen elements as simplified elements automatically reducing the time and space complexity of our designs. 

This structure, these elements are started to look like classes, so I tried to make an abstraction to handle these elements easier with code. Filtering the assemblies
creating business logic such as exporting these elements etc.
